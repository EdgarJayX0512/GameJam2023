该游戏的名字叫做：Jump the gun - 英文释义是抢先一步，但实际上我们做的确实是在枪上跑步
所以游戏的玩法维持跑酷这一题材展开。
游戏特性：
- 玩家将扮演一名跑酷者（一颗子弹）在枪管上跳跃
- 跑动速度会不断增加
- 枪的种类各式各样，有AK有M4A1等等，不同的枪支对应了不同的跳跃技术难点
- 当玩家因操作失误被障碍挤出时游戏失败
- 当玩家不慎掉入竖直着的枪管中时，会被枪管发射上天，游戏失败

The game is called "Jump the Gun," which means "to get ahead of others," but in our case, it's actually running on a gun barrel, so the gameplay revolves around parkour.

Game features:

Players take on the role of a parkour enthusiast (a bullet) running and jumping on the gun barrel.
Running speed gradually increases.
There's a variety of guns, including AKs and M4A1s, each with different jump techniques.
If the player is pushed off the barrel due to a mistake, it's game over.
Falling into a vertically oriented gun barrel launches the player into the sky, resulting in a game over.
